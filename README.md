# music-band https://sue-raisianzadeh.github.io/music-band/
(This is read me which was wrote on April 2019)

This is my first project on the online course “full stack web developer” in 2019. 

This project is written in HTML5 & CSS3 using visual studio software and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
as well I used photoshop to prepare pictures and 1 animated pics on the top of "Photos" page.

It should have been about a  band, but I wanted to choose a music band from my country, as I know more about them. So, my website is about a Persian folk music
band called "Rastak". After doing research and gathering the necessary information about their band I designed this website for them.


First, I prepared an initial wireframe using pen and paper, then improved it as I proceeded with the design process and 
other appealing ideas came to me.
The most important thing I tried to achieve on this website was encouraging users to book this band for their events.
To achieve this goal, I tried to design beautiful pages regarding my knowledge.  

My mentor- Moosa Hassan- helped me make it nicer. I appreciate his help
